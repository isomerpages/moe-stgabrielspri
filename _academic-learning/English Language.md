<p>STELLAR aims to strengthen children’s language oracy and literacy skills
and to promote a positive attitude towards English Language learning in
their foundational years (STELLAR, 2008).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The English Language Syllabus 2020 for the Primary level focuses on the
development, reinforcement and extension of language skills in the primary
years through an enjoyment of the language and the promotion of extensive
reading; and leveraging oracy, reading and writing skills to develop knowledge
and independent use of the language.</p>
<p>EL Syllabus 2020 seeks to develop these competencies in our learners through
the teaching and learning of EL to enable them to be Emphathetic Communicators,
Discerning Readers and Creative Inquirers.</p>

<p><strong><u>EL Monitors</u></strong>
</p>
<p>As Reading Ambassadors in the school, all Primary 3 to Primary 6 EL Monitors
play an active role in their classrooms to share the joy of reading. This
is achieved through their termly book talks to their peers, which include
book recommendations as well as short excerpts of the books being read
aloud. P4 to P6 LMM EL Monitors also promote interesting news articles
in the Little Red Dot publications by giving presentations to the school
on a weekly basis.</p>

<p><strong><u>EL Fiesta</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Recognising that stories are powerful communication tools to create meaning
and connect people, a key feature in our EL programme is the use of stories
to ignite the students’ passion for the English language through termly
activities.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>National Library Board (NLB)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The school continues to build a strong partnership with NLB, which supports
the school through the provision of reading resources and activities. Every
year, we continue to participate in the NLB Read for Books event, a charity
book drive aimed at raising awareness of reading and sharing the gift of
reading with the less privileged.&nbsp;</p>
