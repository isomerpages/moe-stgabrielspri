STELLAR aims to strengthen children’s language oracy and literacy skills and to promote a positive attitude towards English Language learning in their foundational years (STELLAR, 2008).   
  
<u>(I) Primary 1 and 2</u>

At the Lower Primary levels, a strong foundation in English is built through a balanced language and literacy programme using the Shared Book Approach (SBA) and the Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA).

<u>(II) Primary 3 to 6</u>

At the middle and upper primary levels, students will consolidate and extend the language skills already learnt, acquire new skills and knowledge about how language works and progressively develop independence in listening, reading, viewing, speaking, writing and representing through Supported Reading (SR), Know - Want to Know - Learned (K-W-L), Retelling and Writing Process Cycle.
