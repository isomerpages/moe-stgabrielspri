**ST**rategies for **E**nglish **L**anguage **L**earning and **R**eading

STELLAR aims to strengthen children’s language oracy and literacy skills and to promote a positive attitude towards English Language learning in their foundational years (STELLAR, 2008).   
  
<u>(I) Primary 1 and 2</u>

At the Lower Primary levels, a strong foundation in English is built through a balanced language and literacy programme using the Shared Book Approach (SBA) and the Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA).

At the middle and upper primary levels, students will consolidate and extend the language skills already learnt, acquire new skills and knowledge about how language works and progressively develop independence in listening, reading, viewing, speaking, writing and representing through Supported Reading (SR), Know - Want to Know - Learned (K-W-L), Retelling and Writing Process Cycle.

### School-Initiated Programmes

**E**xtensive **R**eading **(ER)** Programme in SGPS   
  

Extensive Reading (ER) programme aims to nurture a lifelong reading habit and promote the joy of reading in Gabrielites. In general, extensive reading ‘involves rapid reading of large quantities of material or longer readings (e.g. whole books) for general understanding, with the focus generally on the meaning of what is being read than on the language’ (Carrell and Carson, 1997, p 49-50). In SGPS, we promote extensive reading through the following:

**Literature Programme (LMM students)**  

The Literature programme’s foundation lies in the extensive research of critical literacy and its theoretical underpinning is based on the research work of Luke and Freebody’s (1999) Four Resources Model and Lehman & Roberts’s (2014) Close Reading Model.

**Events**  

EL Week 2020    
Keep Calm and Read On, the theme of EL Week 2020 aimed to promote love and appreciation for poetry and local literature, as well as a strong reading culture in the school. This year, our very own EL Monitors led a variety of fun recess activities and station games for all Primary 1 to 6 and they were supported by our parent volunteers. Besides the recess activities, our students got to learn more about Singapore’s local authors such as Kelly Ang, the local author of “The Curious Sounds of the Istana”, as well as David Seow and Gabby Tye. Students were also treated to a performance of the Gruffalo play, put up by the Performing Arts CCA group for the assembly period.

**Teachers’ Professional Development**

To ensure that students receive quality curriculum through effective instructional strategies in the classrooms, English Language (EL) teachers constantly keep themselves updated in knowledge and skills through external and in-house workshops and research. In addition, EL teachers continually evaluate their classroom-teaching practices as reflective practitioners, so that they could address their students’ learning needs and to effectively lower their students’ barriers to learning while at the same time piquing their curiosity and inspiring in them a love of learning.

  

Research

<u>Lesson Study</u>

In 2018, P3 and P4 teachers embarked on a Lesson Study to study the impact on reading deeply. The team found that the students deepened their reading with visuals and asking questions. The team moved onto study the use of the strategy, Question-Answer-Relationship (QAR) in answering Open-Ended Comprehension questions in 2019 and 2020. The results of this will be shared at the end of 2020.

In-house Workshops   
SGPS in-house workshops are led by Lead Teacher, Mrs Cecilia Koh and Senior Teacher, Mrs Wendy Chee where the Teacher Leaders would share the findings from their research projects.
