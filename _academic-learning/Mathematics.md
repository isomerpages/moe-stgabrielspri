**Problem Solving Strategies (PSS)**  

Using the spiral approach, students are exposed to different problem solving strategies progressively from Primary 1 to Primary 6. This enables them to be familiar with the various heuristics skills so as to build their confidence in dealing with Math problems. 

To promote meta-cognition among students, students reflect after each strategy has been taught and identify the key features of the different heuristic skills.

**Math Recess Programme**

To nurture their interest and love for Mathematics, we have been organising Mathematics Recess Programmes where students engage themselves in Math Puzzle and Quizzes. This encourages them to collaborate with their peers and engage in mathematical thinking through a fun and exciting way. Through these activities, we hope to fuel the interest of our students and to build their confidence in Mathematics.
