**Department Goal**  
<p align="justify">
The Mathematics Department aims to develop critical and creative problem-solvers and motivated lifelong learners. 
</p>
  
**Key Personnel**  
Head of Department: Mr Andy Kong <br>
Level Head (Internal) : Ms Elsa Teng

**Our National Programme**
<br>**Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) Programme**

<p align="justify">
Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) Programme is an early intervention programme for P1 to P3 students in the area of Mathematics. Through a small group setting and varied activities, the programme aims to provide additional guidance to identified students in developing their numeracy skills.
</p>

Our Mathematics Programme emphasizes on:  

*   Mastery of knowledge and skills
*   Problem solving
*   Critical and creative thinking
*   Reasoning skills
*   Communication skills

**Problem Solving Strategies (PSS)** 
<p align="justify">
Using the spiral approach, students are exposed to different problem solving strategies progressively from Primary 1 to Primary 6. This enables them to be familiar with the various heuristics skills so as to build their confidence in dealing with Math problems.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">
To promote meta-cognition among students, students reflect after each strategy has been taught and identify the key features of the different heuristic skills.
</p>

**Reasoning Strategies** <br>
<p align="justify">
To equip students with critical and inventive thinking skills, students are exposed to different mathematical reasoning strategies. Students are given opportunities to work collaboratively with one another to solve problems using different solutions. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
In addition, students explore generating new problems and reformulate existing ones, engage in mathematical discussions that lead them into deeper understanding of the subject as they practise metacognition.
</p>

**Math Recess Programme** <br>
<p align="justify">
To nurture their interest and love for Mathematics, we have been organising Mathematics Recess Programmes where students engage themselves in Math Puzzle and Quizzes. This encourages them to collaborate with their peers and engage in mathematical thinking through a fun and exciting way. Through these activities, we hope to fuel the interest of our students and to build their confidence in Mathematics.
