2. Inquiry Based Projects (IBL)
An inquiry-based approach shifts the focus to the students themselves, who become active learners as they choose which topics to explore; research these topics; decide what to produce, create, or solve; and then reflect on what they have learned. With a student-centred approach, it helps students to develop knowledge, skills and conceptual understanding.
