<p><strong>Background</strong>
</p>
<p>The Gabrielite Football Academy (GFA) was started to provide our boys
with a holistic education to develop them into Leaders, Sportsmen and Achievers
in 2019. It was the brainchild of our new principal, Mr Martin Tan, who
envisioned a whole school-CCA with a holistic focus for any boy who is
interested to play football at St Gabriel’s Primary School.</p>
<p>Our boys are selected from P1 and put through training on and off the
field. As a footballer, they are trained to improve their individual and
team skills so that they can play football competitively or recreationally.
All our boys are given Inter-School opportunities. As a leader, they are
trained to become eventual junior coaches and referees, where they are
expected to coach the junior players eventually and referee in school based
matches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to all these football related activities, our boys are expected
to do well in their studies and character development, so that they can
become contributing and useful citizens of our school and country.</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Meeting the needs of our boys and parents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using football as a means to achieving all round student development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developing and enhancing the Gabrielite Spirit and Culture.</p>
</li>
</ul>
