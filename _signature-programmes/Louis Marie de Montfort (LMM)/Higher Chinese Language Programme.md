<p>Cultivating students’ interest in the learning of Chinese language has
always been the focus of the Chinese Department in SGPS. In alignment with
our school’s vision, we hope to broaden our student’s learning experience,
provide them with a platform to discover their interest so that they can
plan for their education pathway and achieve their dreams.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some of the programs that have been catered for these students include
Comic Essay Writing Workshop, Learning Language through Drama Workshop,
Learning Journey, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Apart from the above, the LMM students also embarked on Digital Storytelling
to leverage up their proficiency in the language as well as their creative
cognitive skills.</p>
