<p>Designed to ignite a passion for reading and to challenge the way students
interact with the stories that they read, the Literature programme aims
to unravel literary elements such as the Characters, Setting, Plot, Conflict
and Resolution of popular children’s stories. The stories in the programme
are carefully chosen and curated to develop and strengthen Critical Literacy,
Film Literacy and 21st Century Competencies in the students.</p>
<p>From a critical literacy perspective, the world is seen as a socially
constructed text that can be read. Critical literacy involves making sense
of the sociopolitical systems through which we live our lives and questioned
these systems. Through critical literacy, students explore social issues,
including inequalities of race, class, gender, or disability and the ways
in which language is used and other semiotic resources to shape their understanding
of these issues. Film Literacy has been embedded into the Literature programme
so that students can make comparisons between written and visual representations
of a story.</p>

<p><strong>Immersed in the tale of "Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes", Primary 5 students find inspiration to craft their own haikus that echo the fleeting beauty of life. Through the meditative act of folding paper cranes, they channel the resilience and hope embodied in Sadako’s story, intertwining literature, art and history in a meaningful classroom experience.</strong>
