The Literature Programme exposes students to novels and short texts of different genres so that they will be exposed to different styles of writing. A collaboration with a former Principal Master Teacher and Teaching Fellow (NIE, NTU), the programme is customised to the needs of the LMM students such that it stretches their thinking, reading, writing and communication skills. Students will also get to keep the reading materials. The lessons will be conducted during curriculum.
