The Coding Enrichment Programme aims to allow students to learn computational thinking and making, where they are exposed to coding concepts through a blend of software inputs and hardware outputs. As part of the programme, students will be introduced to various sensors which can be attached to a BBC Micro:bit to enhance its functions. Thereafter, the students will undergo a design thinking process where they will work in groups to brainstorm and design solutions to address the issues faced. </p>
