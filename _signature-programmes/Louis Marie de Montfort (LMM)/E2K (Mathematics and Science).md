**E2K Mathematics**


The E2K Mathematics Programme is a mathematics enrichment programme to help students demonstrate interest and ability in Mathematics. It aims to develop in students Mathematical reasoning skills and deepen their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach. Students will have opportunities to collaborate with their peers and engage in Mathematical thinking through puzzles, games and Mathematics explorations. The rich learning experiences offered by the programme serve to help students to develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions mathematicians possess, as well as to gain important 21st century competencies such as critical and inventive thinking and effective communication skills.

**E2K Science**    

The E2K Science Programme is a science enrichment programme for students who demonstrate interest and ability in science. The programme aims to develop scientific inquiry process skills among high-ability students in Science, as well as nurture other important 21st century competencies such as resilience and resourcefulness, critical and inventive thinking, and effective communication skills. Students learn Science by going through the same process that scientists use to generate knowledge in Science. Just as scientists make mistakes in the real world, students are allowed to make mistakes in E2K and teachers help students to learn from the mistakes. Through collaborative learning and guidance provided by the teacher, students practise scientific thinking and reasoning, develop confidence and independence in carrying out scientific inquiry as well as scientific habits, attitudes and dispositions. The lessons will be conducted after school.
