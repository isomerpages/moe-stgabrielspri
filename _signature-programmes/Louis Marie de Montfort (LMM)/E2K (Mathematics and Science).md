<p><strong>E2K Mathematics</strong>
</p>
<p>The E2K Mathematics Programme is offered to students who demonstrate interest
and aptitude in the subject. It develops students' mathematical reasoning
skills and deepens their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach.</p>
<p>During the programme, students will have opportunities to work independently
or collaboratively as they engage in mathematical thinking through specially
designed puzzles, games and mathematical explorations. As a result of these
rich learning experiences, students will:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions mathematicians possess.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gain important 21st century competencies such as critical thinking, invention
thinking and effective communication skills.

<p><strong>E2K Science</strong>
</p>
<p>The E2K Science Programme is a science enrichment programme for students
who demonstrate interest and ability in science. The programme aims to
develop in our students scientific inquiry process skills, as well as nurture
other important 21st century competencies such as resilience and resourcefulness,
critical and inventive thinking, and effective communication skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students learn Science by assimilating the process that scientists use
to generate knowledge in Science. Just as scientists make mistakes in the
real world, students are allowed to make mistakes during the sessions.
Teachers help students to learn from their mistakes. Through collaborative
learning and guidance provided by the teacher, students practise scientific
thinking and reasoning, develop confidence and independence in carrying
out scientific inquiry to answer their research questions.</p>
