	The Innovation Programme (IvP), an initiative from MOE Gifted Education branch, provides a unique opportunity for students to develop their problem-solving and inventive skills to create innovative products to solve problems encountered in our daily lives. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
During the IVP sessions, students experience the design thinking processes. They are taught the skills and strategies to identify problems in real-life, empathise with target users, generate ideas to solve problems, evaluate solutions, conduct research and surveys to gather information and feedback, make prototypes and write reports on their innovations. Students also get the opportunities to obtain feedback on their ideas from expert mentors from the tertiary education institutions who share their expertise in innovation with the students.

Selected students will then partake in the IvP Project Judging where their innovations are presented to a panel of professional innovators. Selected projects are then showcased at the Young Innovators’ Fair and students will present their posters and prototype designs.
