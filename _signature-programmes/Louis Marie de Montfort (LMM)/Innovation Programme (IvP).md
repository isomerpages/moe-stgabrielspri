<p>The Innovation Programme (IvP), an initiative from MOE Gifted Education
branch, provides a unique opportunity for students to develop their problem-solving
and inventive skills to create innovative products to solve problems encountered
in our daily lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the IvP sessions, students experience the design thinking processes.
They are taught the skills and strategies to identify problems in real-life,
empathise with target users, generate ideas to solve problems, evaluate
solutions, conduct research and surveys to gather information and feedback,
make prototypes and write reports on their innovations. Students also get
the opportunities to obtain feedback on their ideas from expert mentors
from the tertiary education institutions who share their expertise in innovation
with the students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Selected students will then partake in the IvP Project Judging where their
innovations are presented to a panel of professional innovators. Selected
projects are then showcased at the Young Innovatorsâ€™ Fair and students
will present their posters and prototype designs.</p>
