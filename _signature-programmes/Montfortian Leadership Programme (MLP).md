**Key Personnel**   
Mr Xie Zhengyang  (Subject Head, Student Leadership)  

**Overview**
<p align="justify">
MLP is designed based on the theoretical underpinnings of the “Student Leadership Challenge” by Kouzes and Posner. The emphasis of The Leadership Challenge® is about how student leaders mobilize others to want to get extraordinary things done. It is about the practices student leaders use to transform values into actions, visions into realities, obstacles into innovations, separateness into solidarity, and risks into rewards. It is about a climate in which people turn challenging opportunities into remarkable successes. </p>

1. Encourage the Heart (Primary 1)  
Accomplishing extraordinary things in school is hard work. To keep hope and determination alive, student leaders recognize contributions that individuals make. In every winning team, the members need to share the rewards of efforts, so young student leaders celebrate accomplishments. They make people feel like heroes.  </p>
 <p align="justify">
2. Model the Way (Primary 2)  
Student Leaders establish principles concerning the ways peer should be treated and the way goals should be pursued. They create standards of excellence and then set an example for others to follow.  </p>
  <p align="justify">
3. Inspire a Shared Vision (Primary 3)  
Student Leaders passionately believe that they can make a difference. They envision the future, creating an ideal and unique image of what the school can become. Through their magnetism and quiet persuasion, student leaders enlist others in their dreams. They breathe life into their visions and get their peers to see exciting possibilities for the future. </p>
<p align="justify">
4. Enable Others to Act (Primary 4)    
Student Leaders foster collaboration and build spirited teams. They actively involve others. Leaders understand that mutual respect is what sustains extraordinary efforts; they strive to create an atmosphere of trust and human dignity. They strengthen others, making each person feel capable and powerful. Higher engagement of students translates to higher productivity and efficiency.  </p>

5. Challenge the Process (Primary 5)   
Student Leaders search for opportunities to challenge the status quo. They look for innovative ways to improve the class and school. In doing so, they experiment and take risks. Student Leaders know how to create an environment that allows exploration, innovation to become more effective and productive.  </p>

6. All Five Practices (Primary 6)     
With the skills learned in their previous 5 years, student leaders strive to apply all practices in their daily lives to become our very own Gabrielite Leader who leads from the Heart.  </p>

**Leadership Development Journey**
<p align="justify">
Since 2015, all Primary 1 to 6 students go through MLP Lessons, 2 hours a term, on 5 Practices and 10 commitments. St. Gabriel’s Primary School approach leadership as measurable, teachable and a learnable set of behaviours. In 2019, we introduced the MLP @ Outdoor Experiential Learning Area (OEL) to provide students with a more integrated and comprehensive leadership experience. The MLP@OEL lessons are conducted during PE lessons, and there are a total of 3 lessons per level. Through the various experiential activities that the students would be exposed to during MLP lessons, it would provide them with a holistic development of the various leadership competencies, preparing them to be Gabrielite Leaders who lead from the heart.   </p>
