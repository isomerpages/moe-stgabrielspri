<br>Mr Xie Zhengyang&nbsp; (Subject Head, Student Leadership)</p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong>
</p>
<p>MLP is designed based on the theoretical underpinnings of the “Student
Leadership Challenge” by Kouzes and Posner. The emphasis of The Leadership
Challenge® is about how student leaders mobilize others to want to get
extraordinary things done. It is about the practices student leaders use
to transform values into actions, visions into realities, obstacles into
innovations, separateness into solidarity, and risks into rewards. It is
about a climate in which people turn challenging opportunities into remarkable
successes.</p>

<p>1. Encourage the Heart (Primary 1) Accomplishing extraordinary things
in school is hard work. To keep hope and determination alive, student leaders
recognize contributions that individuals make. In every winning team, the
members need to share the rewards of efforts, so young student leaders
celebrate accomplishments. They make people feel like heroes.</p>
<p>2. Model the Way (Primary 2) Student Leaders establish principles concerning
the ways peer should be treated and the way goals should be pursued. They
create standards of excellence and then set an example for others to follow.</p>
<p>3. Inspire a Shared Vision (Primary 3) Student Leaders passionately believe
that they can make a difference. They envision the future, creating an
ideal and unique image of what the school can become. Through their magnetism
and quiet persuasion, student leaders enlist others in their dreams. They
breathe life into their visions and get their peers to see exciting possibilities
for the future.</p>
<p>4. Enable Others to Act (Primary 4) Student Leaders foster collaboration
and build spirited teams. They actively involve others. Leaders understand
that mutual respect is what sustains extraordinary efforts; they strive
to create an atmosphere of trust and human dignity. They strengthen others,
making each person feel capable and powerful. Higher engagement of students
translates to higher productivity and efficiency.</p>
<p>5. Challenge the Process (Primary 5) Student Leaders search for opportunities
to challenge the status quo. They look for innovative ways to improve the
class and school. In doing so, they experiment and take risks. Student
Leaders know how to create an environment that allows exploration, innovation
to become more effective and productive.</p>
<p>6. All Five Practices (Primary 6) With the skills learned in their previous
5 years, student leaders strive to apply all practices in their daily lives
to become our very own Gabrielite Leader who leads from the Heart.</p>

<p><strong>Leadership Development Journey</strong>
</p>
<p>Since 2015, all Primary 1 to 6 students go through MLP Lessons, 2 hours
a term, on 5 Practices and 10 commitments. St. Gabriel’s Primary School
approach leadership as measurable, teachable and a learnable set of behaviours.
Through the various experiential activities during MLP lessons, students
are developed holistically in the various leadership competencies. This
prepares them to be Gabrielite Leaders who lead from the heart.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
