**Vision** <br>
Nurturing Gabrielites to become digital innovators and future-ready learners with a strong foundation of 21CC knowledge and skills.

**ALP-GDLP Goals** <br>
Every Gabrielite will develop their digital literacy through Coding and Design problem-based projects, enhancing their 21st-century skills and competencies with Cyber Wellness values as lifelong learners and future-ready citizens.

In preparing Gabrielites to thrive in a rapidly evolving society as future-ready citizens, GDLP will anchor students on a strong foundation of 21st Century Competencies. With the rise of automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI), it is crucial for our Gabrielites to acquire a different set of skills that are essential for success in the 21st century: critical and inventive thinking, problem-solving, communication and collaboration skills, creativity, and digital literacy. GDLP will place greater emphasis on the development of dispositions and competencies to develop and deepen students’ ability to cope with complexity, ambiguity and change in the technology-driven age. Significantly, teaching 21CC skills will enable students to become more informed and engaged citizens who are better equipped to navigate the challenges of our interconnected world and contribute effectively to our communities.

**Introduction**   
<p align="justify">
	GDLP is designed to equip our Gabrielites with digital literacy that will help them take on an active role in the digital world now and in the future. It leverages on the integrative approach of Coding and Design to solve real world problems. It explores the social and cultural practices of digital literacy that enable our students to make the most of their multiple interactions with digital technology and media meaningfully. It will tap into the breadth and depth of Coding and Design to deliver stimulating and engaging experiences to challenge our students to re-imagine the world around them as well as to equip them with the character and skills for the future.</p>

  
**Objectives** <br>

* Nurture students to become creative and innovative learners who are digitally literate and future-ready  
* Cultivate students’ awareness and interest in coding and design through experiential and hands-on learning  
* Develop mindsets and dispositions of our students with 21st CC and cyber wellness principles

The importance of digital literacy will be emphasised through authentic learning contexts anchoring on the theme Smart Nation - Transforming Spaces for Innovation wherein students solve challenges with digital technologies. With the focus on making connected learning to the real world of design, an Applied Learning Model (Figure 1) is conceptualised and developed based on Kolb’s Experiential Learning Cycle to strengthen our learners’ Digital Literacy with 21st Century Skills and Competencies and Cyber Wellness Principles. Our learners will be involved in all the bases of Concrete Experience, Reflective Observation, Abstract Conceptualisation and Active Experimentation in the four-sage learning cycle of the Kolb’s Experiential Learning Cycle. Alignment is also made to MOE’s curriculum on National Digital Literacy Programme1 with its four components in the&nbsp;<b>Find, Think, Apply and Create</b>&nbsp;framework.
