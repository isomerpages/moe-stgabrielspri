<p><strong>Vision</strong> 
<br>Nurturing Gabrielites to become digital innovators and future-ready learners
with a strong foundation of 21CC knowledge and skills.</p>
<p><strong>ALP-GDLP Goals</strong> 
<br>Every Gabrielite will develop their digital literacy through Coding and
Design problem-based projects, enhancing their 21st-century skills and
competencies with Cyber Wellness values as lifelong learners and future-ready
citizens.</p>

<p>In preparing Gabrielites to thrive in a rapidly evolving society as future-ready
citizens, GDLP will anchor students on a strong foundation of 21st Century
Competencies. With the rise of automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI),
it is crucial for our Gabrielites to acquire a different set of skills
that are essential for success in the 21st century: critical and inventive
thinking, problem-solving, communication and collaboration skills, creativity,
and digital literacy. GDLP will place greater emphasis on the development
of dispositions and competencies to develop and deepen students’ ability
to cope with complexity, ambiguity and change in the technology-driven
age. Significantly, teaching 21CC skills will enable students to become
more informed and engaged citizens who are better equipped to navigate
the challenges of our interconnected world and contribute effectively to
our communities.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>GDLP is designed to equip our Gabrielites with digital literacy that will
help them take on an active role in the digital world now and in the future.
It leverages on the integrative approach of Coding and Design to solve
real world problems. It explores the social and cultural practices of digital
literacy that enable our students to make the most of their multiple interactions
with digital technology and media meaningfully. It will tap into the breadth
and depth of Coding and Design to deliver stimulating and engaging experiences
to challenge our students to re-imagine the world around them as well as
to equip them with the character and skills for the future.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong> 
<br>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Nurture students to become creative and innovative learners who are digitally
literate and future-ready</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cultivate students’ awareness and interest in coding and design through
experiential and hands-on learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop mindsets and dispositions of our students with 21st CC and cyber
wellness principles</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The importance of digital literacy will be emphasised through authentic
learning contexts anchoring on the theme Smart Nation - Transforming Spaces
for Innovation wherein students solve challenges with digital technologies.
With the focus on making connected learning to the real world of design,
an Applied Learning Model (Figure 1) is conceptualised and developed based
on Kolb’s Experiential Learning Cycle to strengthen our learners’ Digital
Literacy with 21st Century Skills and Competencies and Cyber Wellness Principles.
Our learners will be involved in all the bases of Concrete Experience,
Reflective Observation, Abstract Conceptualisation and Active Experimentation
in the four-sage learning cycle of the Kolb’s Experiential Learning Cycle.
Alignment is also made to MOE’s curriculum on National Digital Literacy
Programme1 with its four components in the&nbsp;<strong>Find, Think, Apply and Create</strong>&nbsp;framework.</p>
