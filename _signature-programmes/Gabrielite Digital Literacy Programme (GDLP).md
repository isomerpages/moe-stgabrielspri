Despite the current situation, the ALP-GDLP was re-designed and implemented across four stages from May to November in 2021. Our young digital learners get to be creative and innovate ideas to design virtual Scratch games, build prototypes and solve real-world problems with Micro:bits and Strawbees for their Smart Home/School projects. Through this GDLP experience, they strengthened their team bonding and became more resilient when tackling digital challenges with their classmates. Significantly, they have experienced the digital skills of the future, developed their 21CC skill set and practised sound Cyber Wellness values within authentic contexts. </p>

<p align="justify">
The school has launched an applied learning programme known as the <b>Gabrielite Digital Literacy Programme (GDLP)</b> for Primary 3 students. We recognise that digital literacy is a vital skillset to prepare our Gabrielites for the future. GDLP will equip our young digital users with the knowledge, skills and attitude that allow them to be safe and empowered in an increasingly digital world.</p>

**Introduction**   
<p align="justify">
	GDLP is designed to equip our Gabrielites with digital literacy that will help them take on an active role in the digital world now and in the future. It leverages on the integrative approach of Coding and Design to solve real world problems. It explores the social and cultural practices of digital literacy that enable our students to make the most of their multiple interactions with digital technology and media meaningfully. It will tap into the breadth and depth of Coding and Design to deliver stimulating and engaging experiences to challenge our students to re-imagine the world around them as well as to equip them with the character and skills for the future.</p>

  
**Objectives** <br>

* Nurture students to become creative and innovative learners who are digitally literate and future-ready  
* Cultivate students’ awareness and interest in coding and design through experiential and hands-on learning  
* Develop mindsets and dispositions of our students with 21st CC and cyber wellness principles 

  
<p align="justify">
The importance of digital literacy will be emphasised through authentic learning contexts anchoring on the theme Smart Nation - Transforming Spaces for Innovation wherein students solve challenges with digital technologies. With the focus on making connected learning to the real world of design, an Applied Learning Model (Figure 1) is conceptualised and developed based on Kolb’s Experiential Learning Cycle to strengthen our learners’ Digital Literacy with 21st Century Skills and Competencies and Cyber Wellness Principles. Our learners will be involved in all the bases of Concrete Experience, Reflective Observation, Abstract Conceptualisation and Active Experimentation in the four-sage learning cycle of the Kolb’s Experiential Learning Cycle. Alignment is also made to MOE’s curriculum on National Digital Literacy Programme1 with its four components in the <b>Find, Think, Apply and Create</b> framework.
