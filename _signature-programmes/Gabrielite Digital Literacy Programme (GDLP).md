<p><strong>Vision</strong> 
<br>Nurturing Gabrielites to become digital innovators and future-ready learners
with a strong foundation of 21CC knowledge and skills.</p>
<p><strong>ALP-GDLP Goals</strong> 
<br>Every Gabrielite will develop their digital literacy through Coding and
Design problem-based projects, enhancing their 21st-century skills and
competencies with Cyber Wellness values as lifelong learners and future-ready
citizens.</p>

<p>At St. Gabriel’s Primary School, we are committed to preparing our students
to thrive in a fast-changing world. In 2025, our Gabrielite Digital Literacy
Programme (GDLP) will continue to anchor students on a strong foundation
of 21st Century Competencies (21CC), developing future-ready Gabrielites
who are critical thinkers, creative problem-solvers, effective communicators,
and collaborative team players.</p>
<p>As we move into an era increasingly shaped by automation and Artificial
Intelligence (AI), it is essential for our Gabrielites to acquire the skills
and mindsets needed to navigate complexity, ambiguity, and change. Through
GDLP, students will deepen their digital literacy, enhance their problem-solving
abilities, and strengthen their adaptability - all key aspects of thriving
in the technology-driven age.</p>
<p>In line with our school’s desired outcomes, LSA 2.0 (Leader, Sportsman,
Achiever), GDLP will integrate Smart and Sustainable Nation projects, offering
authentic and meaningful opportunities for Gabrielites to apply their learning
to real-world issues. Through these projects, students will not only develop
their 21CC but also cultivate a sense of responsibility, innovation, and
global awareness - equipping them to contribute thoughtfully and effectively
to our interconnected world.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>GDLP is designed to equip our Gabrielites with digital literacy that will
help them take on an active role in the digital world now and in the future.
It leverages on the integrative approach of Coding and Design to solve
real world problems. It explores the social and cultural practices of digital
literacy that enable our students to make the most of their multiple interactions
with digital technology and media meaningfully. It will tap into the breadth
and depth of Coding and Design to deliver stimulating and engaging experiences
to challenge our students to re-imagine the world around them as well as
to equip them with the character and skills for the future.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong> 
<br>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Nurture students to become creative and innovative learners who are digitally
literate and future-ready</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cultivate students’ awareness and interest in coding and design through
experiential and hands-on learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop mindsets and dispositions of our students with 21st CC and cyber
wellness principles</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The importance of digital literacy will be emphasised through authentic
learning contexts anchoring on the theme Smart Nation - Transforming Spaces
for Innovation wherein students solve challenges with digital technologies.
With the focus on making connected learning to the real world of design,
an Applied Learning Model (Figure 1) is conceptualised and developed based
on Kolb’s Experiential Learning Cycle to strengthen our learners’ Digital
Literacy with 21st Century Skills and Competencies and Cyber Wellness Principles.
Our learners will be involved in all the bases of Concrete Experience,
Reflective Observation, Abstract Conceptualisation and Active Experimentation
in the four-sage learning cycle of the Kolb’s Experiential Learning Cycle.
Alignment is also made to MOE’s curriculum on National Digital Literacy
Programme1 with its four components in the&nbsp;<strong>Find, Think, Apply and Create</strong>&nbsp;framework.</p>
