**Background**     
We acknowledge that all Gabrielites have different areas of strengths. We also recognize that amongst our Gabrielites, are boys who learn at a different pace and these boys would benefit from a more robust and academically challenging curriculum. 

As such, there arose a need for a differentiated curriculum to cater to them which saw the introduction of the St Louis Marie de Montfort (LMM) class in 2016.

  

**Rationale**      
According to research by leading professional in the Gifted Education field, Dr Joyce Van Tassel-Baska noted that there were three fundamental differences that distinguish the gifted from more typical learners. Firstly, these students have the capacity to learn at faster rates. Secondly, they are capable of finding, solving and acting on problems more readily. Thirdly, they are able to manipulate abstract ideas and make connections more easily.

As such, there is a need for differentiated curriculum based on these differences and this is where the school will be catering to the needs of the group of students with a different ability and pace of learning through the LMM class.

  

**Objectives**     
In alignment with Gabrielite 2025, apart from developing our students to be a Leader, Sportsman and Achiever, the LMM classes aims to achieve the following objectives:
* Provide a compelling learning experience that cultivates the spirit of life-long learning
* Cater to the needs of a group of students with a different ability and pace of learning
* Expose students to a wide variety of educational opportunities and disciplines that are not provided through regular instructional programme.
