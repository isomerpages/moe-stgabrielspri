Our Vision - A Gabrielite will be God-loving, disciplined, gracious, caring and a life-long learner.  
Our Mission - Shaping Lives for Service to God and Nation.  
Our Motto - The Latin motto "Labor Omnia Vincit" stands for "Labour conquers all things."  
  
Our School's Corporate Video showcases the student as the centre of focus for his well-being and development here in St. Gabriel's Primary School. We would also like to highlight our Gabrielite 2025 Outcomes - a Leader, a Sportsman and an Achiever towards realising our school's Vision, Mission and Motto.
