Find out more through an informative talk by our Principal, Mr Martin Tan on the history of St. Gabriel's Primary School and our founder, St. Louis Marie De Montfort. In the video, he highlights the school's virtues and the student outcomes of our Gabrielite 2025 - a Leader, a Sportsman, an Achiever and many of our key initiatives for our students. Our Assistant Year Head, Mr Andy Kong also clearly defines what it takes to be a Gabrielite of the future. We hope you find the video useful and that St. Gabriel's Primary School will be a choice school for your child.

**Inquiry-Based Learning @ SGPS**   
In St. Gabriel’s Primary School, our Primary 1 to Primary 5 Gabrielites embark on Inquiry Based Learning (IBL) projects based on their level’s learning outcomes. IBL is a learning methodology that centers on student centricity. Fundamentally, Gabrielites take charge of their own learning. They are encouraged to explore the resources and materials through questioning and sharing of ideas. Inquiry-based learning uses different approaches to learning, including Collaborative learning, small-group discussion and guided learning.   

  

Gabrielites learn through constructivism, this allows them to build knowledge through exploration, construction, experience, and meaningful conversation. These provide Gabrielites with experiences which build on their interest and stimulate their curiosity about the world.
