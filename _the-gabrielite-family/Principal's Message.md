<strong><center>Mr Martin Tan<br>Principal</center></strong>

Our school mission “Shaping Lives for Service to God and Nation” requires us to constantly reflect on the purpose of a Gabrielite education. I have had the privilege of meeting many of the old boys who have pledged their strong support for their alma mater. This is heartening as it is a testimony of their pride, loyalty and confidence in the quality of the Gabrielite education. In line with the school’s core educational philosophy ‘Love each child as your own’, I am constantly heartened by the teachers’ enthusiasm and positivity toward student learning in the school. I can sense their love for the children and the desire to help every child realize their potential. 

In St Gabriel’s Primary School, we have a dedicated team of staff who are constantly on the look out for the well-being and holistic development of our boys. With the current emphasis on reducing examination stress and enhancing the joy of learning, the teachers have also role-modelled life-long learning as they collaborate, learn, and plan more engaging and exciting lessons for the boys. In daily lessons, there is now a stronger emphasis for the boys to collaborate with each other in their learning. They interact deeper with each other as they internalise the academic knowledge taught and acquire life-skills that will enable them to be contributing members of the community. 

The Gabrielite education has always focused on the inculcation of virtues in our boys, and this will continue to be so. We have seen the boys flying the Gabrielite flag high by doing well in various competitions and events. Active participation in CCAs and sports is a great way to build both character and resilience in our boys. Apart from skills and knowledge, CCAs offer an authentic platform for soft skills such as leadership, communication and collaboration. In delivering a quality Gabrielite education, the school will continue to focus on CCAs and other co-curricular opportunities to provide a holistic education for our boys.       

I am honoured to be given the opportunity to serve as Principal of St Gabriel’s Primary School. My staff and I will continue to make every effort to ensure the well-being of our boys. We will continue to treat each child as our own. The boys are the reason for the school’s existence. Labor Omnia Vincit!
