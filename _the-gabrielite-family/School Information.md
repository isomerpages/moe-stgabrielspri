    <td class="tg-ge7m"><span style="color:#232323"><p align="justify"> St Gabriel’s Primary School is a government-aided mission school and we are part of the Gabrielite family of schools in Singapore.   The Motto of the school, Labor Omnia Vincit (Labour conquers all things) encompasses the vision of the Brothers of St. Gabriel’s to develop our young Gabrielites into gentlemen who uphold Christian values so as to be of service to God and Nation.</span><br><br>Morning prayers are said every day during the general assembly and monthly masses are held in the Chapel of St. Louis Marie de Montfort.  The Catholic Club, a CCA, is also available to develop in pupils a life of piety and to live the virtues. Marian devotions are also promoted during the month of May and October.<br><br>Virtues, which is the results of good habits acquired, leads to good character. In St. Gabriel’s Primary we have identified these eight virtues to guide our character formation:  Loyalty, Orderliness, Respect, Diligence, Self-discipline, Generosity, Perseverance, and Sincerity (LORD SGPS).  A whole school approach is adopted in encouraging our young Gabrielites to live out the various virtues in whichever activities they may be engaged in.  All Gabrielites learn about the universal values of our founder, St. Louis Marie de Montfort, through his stories and life experiences. Lessons are also dedicated to Religious Education for our Catholic Gabrielites and for non-Catholics who have opted to be part of Religious Education classes.

    <td class="tg-7qht">Holistic Education</td>
    <td class="tg-ge7m"><span style="color:#232323"><p align="justify"> At St. Gabriel’s Primary, we believe that an education should not just develop the whole person (mind and Character) but to get him ready for the future.  True learning can only be obtained with a diverse learning community where pupils and teachers from different background work, learn and succeed together. We seek to teach   our boys a deep and abiding respect for the power of knowledge and imagination, the method of reasoning and sound moral decision making.</span><br>In establishing certain academic rigour and behaviour standards, we seek to develop within our young Gabrielites the sort of self-respect that comes only when one contributes meaningfully to his own community.  In all persuits and daily interactions, our Gabrielites are reminded of the importance of character, and of their responsibilities to the community.</td>
