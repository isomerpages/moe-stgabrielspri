**School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos**    
Core Belief: Loving Each Child as our Own

  

Established as part of the St. Gabriel's School in 1953, the school follows the footsteps of our founder, St. Louis Marie de Montfort, whose belief was to 'Love each child as a son of God'. Staff strives to love each child as our own.Â 

  

Educational Philosophy : Keeping the Flame Alive, The Gift is Theirs, Giving Pupils a Voice, The Community Connect

  

We are committed to truly educating the students by nurturing in them, the 'flame of inquiry' so that they will be prepared for a life of learning. A suite of effective academic programmes cater to the different learning needs, styles and interests of our pupils - the Inquiry Week, the Louis Marie de Montfort (LMM) class for the academically gifted, and bridging programmes for those who need the support. We believe that every child is 'gifted' and inspire them to discover their potential. A stable of co-curricular activities that is varied and interesting provides an exciting and immersive school experience for students. Each child is given a 'voice' so that they may learn to have a heart for others, through service to God and the nation. We provide opportunities for students to live out the school virtues of Self-discipline, Generosity, Perseverance, Sincerity, Loyalty, Orderliness, Respect and Diligence through opportunities to 'connect with the community'.
