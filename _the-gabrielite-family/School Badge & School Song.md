**School Badge**

The centrepiece of the school crest is the Coat of Arm, which has four quadrants.Â The top-left quadrant has the letters A.M. with the lily flower that is an abbreviation for "Ave Maria". This was the greeting of the Angel Gabriel to Mary, the mother of Jesus. This is also the beginning of the "Hail Mary" prayer. According to St. Louis Marie de Montfort, Wisdom can be attained through living a life of gentleness and authenticity, modelled after Mary the mother of God.  

The bottom-right quadrant has the letters D+S with a cross. D.S. is the abbreviation for Dieu Seul, which is God Alone in French. God Alone is the all-motivating force in the life of St. Louis Marie de Montfort. To him God is the centre of his life and in everything he does God is foremost for him. For St. Louis Marie de Montfort, all knowledge comes to nothing if one does not know God. Thus to know all things but not to know God is to know nothing at all.  

On the top-right quadrant there is the sailboat at sea. It symbolizes that in life there will be struggle and mortification that we shall experience. Much like the ship at sea, we will come out the better if we are able to weather through the storms of life. No problem is too great to overcome and it is in perseverance and resilience that one shall be able to face all difficulties in life.  

On the bottom-left quadrant there is the Star and the man in the boat. This symbolizes the Star of the sea, where seamen navigate to their destination in the vast ocean. If we are focused on the essential values of life, we shall reach our ultimate destiny in life. The Star of the sea shall be the guiding light that lights up the way in our life.  

The Crest is adorned with green olive branches, which is derived from Ancient Greece, to symbolize peace and prosperity. It is thus the duty of each one to promote peace in the world, a peace that will last. Coupled with peace is that of prosperity which connotes not only the generation of wealth but also the integral development of human society. The Crest carries the Latin motto "Labor Omnia Vincit" which stands for "Labour conquers all things". Hard work embodied in diligence and perseverance leads one to achieve greater things in life. It can thus be said that in whatever you do, do your best.
