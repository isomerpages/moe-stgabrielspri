Despite the heavy downpour, spirits were not dampened as Gabrielites from the different eras turned up to mark the joyous celebration. It was indeed heart-warming as the whole school cheered their lungs out when the school flag was once again brought into the hall by the walk leader and handed over to our Principal, Miss Antonia Teng who in turn passed it to the Head Prefect to symbolise the return of the Gabrielites. When the school song was played, it was an emotional affair for many as the boys were singing with so much gusto. There was simply so much pride in the air. It was indeed a homecoming ceremony befitting the importance of the event. The boys cheered even more loudly when Bro. Emmanuel (Supervisor), Bro. Gasper (Titular Superior), Mr. Henry Phang (Chairman, SMC) and Mr Yeo Ann Tai (Vice-Chairman, SMC) went on stage for the ribbon-cutting ceremony. The day ended with a mass in the hall for the Catholics while the rest of the school proceeded to explore the new home of the young Gabrielites.<br><br>    For more information of the school’s history, please visit the school’s Heritage Gallery.

**School Crest**

<img src="/images/BOSTCrest-trans-colour.gif" 
     style="width:65%">
		 
<p align="justify"> The centrepiece of the school crest is the Coat of Arm, which has four quadrants. The top-left quadrant has the letters A.M. with the lily flower that is an abbreviation for "Ave Maria". This was the greeting of the Angel Gabriel to Mary, the mother of Jesus. This is also the beginning of the "Hail Mary" prayer. According to St. Louis Marie de Montfort, Wisdom can be attained through living a life of gentleness and authenticity, modelled after Mary the mother of God.  

<p align="justify"> The bottom-right quadrant has the letters D+S with a cross. D.S. is the abbreviation for Dieu Seul, which is God Alone in French. God Alone is the all-motivating force in the life of St. Louis Marie de Montfort. To him God is the centre of his life and in everything he does God is foremost for him. For St. Louis Marie de Montfort, all knowledge comes to nothing if one does not know God. Thus to know all things but not to know God is to know nothing at all.  

<p align="justify"> On the top-right quadrant there is the sailboat at sea. It symbolizes that in life there will be struggle and mortification that we shall experience. Much like the ship at sea, we will come out the better if we are able to weather through the storms of life. No problem is too great to overcome and it is in perseverance and resilience that one shall be able to face all difficulties in life.  

<p align="justify"> On the bottom-left quadrant there is the Star and the man in the boat. This symbolizes the Star of the sea, where seamen navigate to their destination in the vast ocean. If we are focused on the essential values of life, we shall reach our ultimate destiny in life. The Star of the sea shall be the guiding light that lights up the way in our life.  

<p align="justify"> The Crest is adorned with green olive branches, which is derived from Ancient Greece, to symbolize peace and prosperity. It is thus the duty of each one to promote peace in the world, a peace that will last. Coupled with peace is that of prosperity which connotes not only the generation of wealth but also the integral development of human society. The Crest carries the Latin motto "Labor Omnia Vincit" which stands for "Labour conquers all things". Hard work embodied in diligence and perseverance leads one to achieve greater things in life. It can thus be said that in whatever you do, do your best.

**School Song**

St Gabriel's boys, here on this day unite <br> 
With one true heart let us all sing and cheer <br>
The stately home where our boyhood is guided<br>
Learning to live and through right paths to steer<br>
In cheering blue and spotless white apparel <br>
A cheerful band, St Gabriel's boys unite! <br>
All white and blue, all bent to reap the laurel <br>
Hold and defend Alma Mater's Glory with heart and might<br><br>Chorus:<br><br>
Saint Gabriel's School dear <br>
Here willing hearts behold <br>
When duty's call rings clear <br>
Mid sorrows as through joys <br>
For Singapore and God <br>
For Justice to uphold <br>
Let us live and thus prove <br>
Saint Gabriel's boys.
