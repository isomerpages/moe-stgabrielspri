**School Motto**

     style="width:65%">


<p align="justify"> 
The Latin motto "Labor Omnia Vincit" stands for
<b>Labour conquers all things.</b> Hard work embodied in diligence and perseverance leads one to achieve greater things in life. <b>It can thus be said that in whatever you do, do your best.</b>

<p align="justify"> The motto personifies the importance of giving one's best in all endeavours. It is our hope that each student will approach learning with passion and perseverance; that he will form lasting friendships and thus understand the meaning of loyalty, sincerity and fellowship; that he will become socially responsible citizens who would learn from the youngest age how to give of themselves for the greater good; that he will laugh and play and enjoy being a boy. Above all, he must always be mindful of God's grace and presence.

**School Philosophy**  
Core Belief: Loving Each Child as our Own

<p align="justify"> Established as part of the St. Gabriel’s School in 1953, the school follows the footsteps of our founder, St. Louis Marie de Montfort, whose belief was to ‘Love each child as a son of God’. Staff strives to love each child as our own.
