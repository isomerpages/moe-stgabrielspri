The Latin motto "Labor Omnia Vincit" stands for "**Labour conquers all things.**" Hard work embodied in diligence and perseverance leads one to achieve greater things in life.Â **It can thus be said that in whatever you do, do your best.**

The motto personifies the importance of giving one's best in all endeavours. It is our hope that each student will approach learning with passion and perseverance; that he will form lasting friendships and thus understand the meaning of loyalty, sincerity and fellowship; that he will become socially responsible citizens who would learn from the youngest age how to give of themselves for the greater good; that he will laugh and play and enjoy being a boy. Above all, he must always be mindful of God's grace and presence.
