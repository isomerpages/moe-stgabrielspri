The mission of Shaping Lives for Service to God and Nation is one that is shared by all the Montfortian and Gabrielite schools. The vision is ‘A Gabrielite is God-loving, disciplined, gracious, caring and a life-long learner’. Similar to the set of school virtues, the vision is largely about developing the character of the students. Three key student outcomes were added in 2019 to provide clarity in terms of the Gabrielite the school hopes to produce. Developing a Leader, Sportsman and Achiever became key student outcomes of the Gabrielite 2025 Strategic Plan. As evident from the unpacking, the outcomes reflect a combination of attitudes and competencies that would help Gabrielites succeed in the future. This was co-created and conceptualized after a process of staff consultation and discussion. It included reaching consensus in terms of the indicators for each of the outcomes which was important for a shared understanding amongst its staff. The Gabrielite 2025 Strategic Plan built on the earlier plan and focused on three Strategic Thrusts instead of four. ST1 focused on the character development of the students with the student outcomes of Leader, Sportsman and Achiever clearly spelt out. ST2 emphasised the importance of providing an engaging teaching and learning experience and developing 21 CC while ST3 centred on building staff capacity. </p>
