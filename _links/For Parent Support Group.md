The Parent Support Group @ SGPS was established in 2008. Since then, PSG@SGPS has played a vital role as an important partner of the school, supporting the holistic development and formation of our Gabrielite boys.</p>

<p align="justify">
Being part of PSG@SGPS provides us with an opportunity to foster a closer bond with our children, enabling us to understand them better. Intentional involvement in your child’s school experience sends a clear signal to your child that you are walking alongside them on their journey, encouraging them to adopt positive lifelong attitudes towards learning and helping them on their path to becoming Leader, Sportsman and Achiever.</p>

<p align="justify">
PSG@SGPS is made up of a group of dedicated parents who come together to offer collaboration and support; playing an active and important role in being the bridge between the parents, students and the school. &nbsp;</p>

<p align="justify">
PSG@SGPS works to complement the school’s programs, with guidance and direction from the school’s advisors, striving to promote the spirit of community within the SGPS family.&nbsp;</p>

As a member of PSG@SGPS, your participation in school activities will enable you to engage and connect with your child more on their school experience. </p>
