<p>The Parent Support Group @ SGPS was established in 2008. Since then, PSG@SGPS
has played a vital role as an important partner of the school, supporting
the holistic development and formation of our Gabrielite boys.</p>
<p>Being part of PSG@SGPS provides us with an opportunity to foster a closer
bond with our children, enabling us to understand them better. Intentional
involvement in your child’s school experience sends a clear signal to your
child that you are walking alongside them on their journey, encouraging
them to adopt positive lifelong attitudes towards learning and helping
them on their path to becoming Leader, Sportsman and Achiever.</p>
<p>PSG@SGPS is made up of a group of dedicated parents who come together
to offer collaboration and support; playing an active and important role
in being the bridge between the parents, students and the school. &nbsp;</p>
<p>PSG@SGPS works to complement the school’s programs, with guidance and
direction from the school’s advisors, striving to promote the spirit of
community within the SGPS family.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a member of PSG@SGPS, your participation in school activities will
enable you to engage and connect with your child more on their school experience.</p>
