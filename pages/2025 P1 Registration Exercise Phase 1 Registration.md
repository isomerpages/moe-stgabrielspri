<p>Dear Parents / Guardians</p>
<p>Phase 1 registration is for a Singapore Citizen (SC) or Permanent Resident
(PR) child born between 2 January 2018 and 1 January 2019 (both dates inclusive)
and has a sibling currently studying in our school.</p>
<p>Parents who are registering their younger child under Phase 1 are to <strong>register during the Phase 1 registration period in early July 2024.</strong>
</p>
<p>If your child is a non-SC / non-PR and thus not eligible for Phase 1,
please submit an online Indication of Interest in end May/early June 2024.</p>
