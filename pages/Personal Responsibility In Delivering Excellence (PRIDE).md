<p><strong>Head of Department / Subject Head:</strong>
<br>Ms Nur Halima (Level Head, Student Leadership (Internal))</p>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong>
<br>The PRIDE Team comprises of the Heads and Vice-Heads of the following
groups of Leaders:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Prefects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peer Support Leaders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NE Ambassadors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CCA Leaders</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In P.R.I.D.E, we want to make sure that these PRIDE leaders have the skills
to lead, to excel and to overcome challenges. Members will have the opportunities
to attend leadership forums and workshops organised by external agencies
to further hone their self and group leadership skills. This opportunity
is rare and will be a great platform for students to develop Personal Responsibility
In Delivering Excellence (P.R.I.D.E)</p>
<p>Through meaningful roles and competency building modules, we hope that
our student leaders will be able to apply what they have learned. Together,
they will guide and work with different student leaders around the school
to plan, implement and execute student-initiated Values-In-Action (VIA)
projects that would benefit the school or community.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives:</strong> 
<br>
</p>
<p>Student leaders in PRIDE would be able to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>explain why leadership is important for personal effectiveness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>apply effective time management and learn about planning skills according
to their learning styles and attributes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>apply effective techniques to lead self and others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop and share with their peers their individualised action plans to
realise their personal goals for the class and/or the school and even the
community.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PRIDE Initiatives</strong> 
<br>
</p>
<p>Since established, the PRIDE team has worked on a number of projects which
created a positive impact on the lives of the students and teachers within
the school. These projects include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Teacher’s Locker Photo</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It has been noticed that students who were tasked to deposit books into
their teacher’s locker often encountered the problem of trying to locate
the locker. This could be due to the students not being able to recognize
their teachers’ name, which is especially true for the lower primary students.
As such, the PRIDE team picked up this problem and worked on it. As a team,
they discussed and eventually came up with the solution of pasting the
teacher’s photo beside the locker, which they planned and executed all
by themselves.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Recycling Bins in School</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Students in the school are highly encouraged to recycle things that they
do not want anymore. However, there are only 2 recycling bins in the school
and they are located at Level 1. Having only 2 recycling bins also meant
that these bins would often be filled up quickly. Thus, the PRIDE team
identified this problem and worked together with the members of the Science,
Horticulture and Mathematics (SHM) club to purchase and design more recycling
bins to be placed at every level. This initiative allowed students to be
able to drop off their recyclable items much easily. Apart from that, the
collaboration also saw the students coming up with slides to be presented
to the rest of the school during assembly on raising the awareness of recycling.</p>
