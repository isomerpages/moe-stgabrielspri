<p align="justify">
The PAL pedagogy provides opportunities for our young Gabrielites to exhibit the desired behaviour aligned to our school vision and virtues. Our school vision 'A Gabrielite will be God-loving, disciplined, gracious, caring and a life-long learner.' is embedded in all six PAL modules - Sports and Games, and Outdoor Education, Visual Arts, and Performing Arts on Music, Dance and Drama. </p>

<p align="justify">
Anchoring on a boy-centric approach, every module promotes multi-sensory learning experiences that are meaningful and enjoyable for our young Gabrielites; engaging the visual, auditory, tactile and kinaesthetic through stories, imagery and manipulatives. During a 2-hour PAL lesson each week, the boys will participate in interactive and hands-on activities to embrace social-emotional learning competencies such as social awareness, responsible decision-making and relationship management while working as a team. They will also encounter problems and challenges so that they live up to the school vision while displaying the school virtues like self-discipline, respect and generosity. </p>
