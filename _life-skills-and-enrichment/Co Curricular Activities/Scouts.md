Our Cub Scouts consists of boys between P3 and P6. The objective of this CCA is to provide a group environment which is intellectually stimulating, physically vital and directed towards satisfying the child’s basic need to face and overcome challenges. 

  

Our activities are based on the natural sense of fun and enthusiasm of the age group and thus the training is achieved largely through games, interaction in small groups and activities. These activities include craft work, outdoor cooking, singing, knotting, map reading, first-aid and camping. 

Besides our scouting experiences in school, we also took part in district and national events such Job Week, leadership camps and community programmes such as the Braddell Heights Stamp-out Dengue Drive. 

  

Through these activities, we hope to develop each member into a self-reliant, supportive and responsible person.
