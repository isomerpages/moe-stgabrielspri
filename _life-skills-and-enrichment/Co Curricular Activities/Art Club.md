Art Club is an platform for students to explore materials beyond their classroom art curriculum. Students across Primary 3, 4, 5 and 6 come together once a week to learn different skills and create art through inquiry and observation.  These activities involve various  art forms such as oil pastels, water colour paint on different types of paper and collages. These art club sessions will allow students to express themselves through creativity.

We started 2020 with a blast by learning about the local artist, Paul Wang, an urban sketcher. Through exploring his techniques and artwork, students learn observational skills through different exercises in the art room. Their experiences are further enhanced by on-location drawing at different parts of the school. We also have plans for our art club students to explore other means of art creation such as paper quilling and acrylic painting of furniture such as chairs.
