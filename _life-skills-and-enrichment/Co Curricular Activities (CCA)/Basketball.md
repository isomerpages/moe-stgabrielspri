Welcome to SGPS’s Basketball CCA! Our CCA is relatively new, started just last year. We train once a week under a professional coach. Besides learning fundamental basketball skills, our boys also learn to play as a team. Basketball is a team sport and a team is only as strong as its weakest member. Hence, we value teamwork for our CCA. Our boys have to consider each member as important. Besides developing our students’ basketball skills, we want to build their character, to nurture them into Gabrielites who have good sportsmanship.
