SGPS Badminton CCA comprises the developmental and recreational teams. The developmental team trains twice a week whilst the recreational players train weekly for two hours. Selected members from the developmental team make up the junior and senior teams, which represent the school in inter-school competitions. Training sessions for the school teams increase in both intensity and frequency prior to the competitions.</p>

Under the guidance of the teachers and coaches, our senior and more experienced players also assist in the training of selected groups of younger players.&nbsp; Through this, they are able to apply the skills they have learnt over the years and it is also a good opportunity to hone their leadership skills. </p>
