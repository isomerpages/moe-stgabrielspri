<p align="justify">
The Golf CCA aims to ignite enthusiasm in the sport. As students learn the basic skills in golf, they are also inculcated with life skills like decision-making, problem-solving and self-awareness as well as school virtues such as respect, self-discipline and perseverance. </p>

<p align="justify">
The curriculum is specifically designed to be progressive, consisting of three levels, namely Birdie (P2), Eagle (P3 and P4) and Albatross (P5 and P6).Â </p>

<p align="justify">
Training is conducted in two modes - in-house training in school and training at the Golf Range (Sembawang Country Club). In addition, course play in the green is also part of the training for Eagles and Albatross. </p>
