The Golf CCA aims to ignite enthusiasm in the sport. As students learn the basic skills in golf, they are also inculcated with life skills like decision-making, problem-solving and self-awareness as well as school virtues such as respect, self-discipline and perseverance.

The curriculum is specifically designed to be progressive, consisting of three levels, namely Birdie (P2), Eagle (P3 and P4) and Albatross (P5 and P6).Â 

Training is conducted in two modes - in-house training in school and training at the Golf Range (Sembawang Country Club). In addition, course play in the green is also part of the training for Eagles and Albatross.
