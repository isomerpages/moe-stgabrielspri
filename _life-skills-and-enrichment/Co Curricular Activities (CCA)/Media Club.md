<p>The Media Club provides a platform for students to develop and showcase
their ideas and creativity through new media. Our students’ competencies
are built upon by equipping them with the skills that are essential in
helping them communicate their ideas through a wide range of platforms.
To develop student’s digital literacy and also to keep up with trending
technologies, the Media Club members are given opportunities to explore
AI, Social Robotics, Augmented Reality during their training sessions.</p>
<p>2023 was an exciting year for our club members! The Media Club members
embarked on the journey of understanding how AI is implemented in social
robots. They gained insights about the use of social robots such as NAO
in education, healthcare, and research fields. Our members learned how
social robots help to promote social emotional learning in the education
sector. They even had a chance to interact with the NAO robot!</p>
<p>On top of that, our club members participated in the Digital for Life
Festival organized by IMDA. They were given the opportunity to apply what
they learnt by sharing their knowledge about the various digital apps with
a group of seniors.</p>
<p>In the media club, we strive to promote the use of digital tools as well
as educating our young Gabrielites the importance of being a responsible
user of new media technology.</p>
