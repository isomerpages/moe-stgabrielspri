For athletics, the teachers and coach train the boys once a week. The teachers and coach focus a lot on their fundamentals like jumping, skipping, running form and many other aspects of athletics. The boys are allowed to try any event like sprinting and throwing. Apart from training, the boys are also taught discipline and perseverance.&nbsp;
