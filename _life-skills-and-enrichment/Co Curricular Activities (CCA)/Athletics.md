For athletics, the teachers and coach train the boys once a week. The teachers and coach focus a lot on their fundamentals like jumping, skipping, running form and many other aspects of athletics. The boys are allowed to try any event like sprinting and throwing. Apart from training, the boys are also taught discipline and perseverance.Â 

  

The teachers are there to not only ensure safety and discipline but to also teach the boys social and emotional competencies like social and self awareness, relationship management, responsible decision making and self management. This will turn them into sportsman, leaders and achievers.
