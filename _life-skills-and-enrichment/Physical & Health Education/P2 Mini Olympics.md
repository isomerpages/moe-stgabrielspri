Welcome to SGPS! For P2 mini-Olympics, students exhibit their gymnastic mastery. Educational gymnastics improve studentsâ€™ flexibility and coordination, and bone health and muscular strength. Besides physical development, students also improve in their self-confidence, as they learn and execute new movements safely. It is marvellous to observe students from different gymnastics background interacting and learning!
