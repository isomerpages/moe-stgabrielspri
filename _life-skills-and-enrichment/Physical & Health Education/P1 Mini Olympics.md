Welcome to St. Gabrielâ€™s Primary! At our school, we believe that play is important. Life is time. Imagine, living without playing. When we play, during physical education, we develop ourselves completely: physically, socially, cognitively & emotionally. For our students, play helps them to practice what they have learned. They learn more by playing. The P1 Mini-Olympics provides our students the opportunity to learn a wide range of physical skills, to develop their fundamental movement skills for sports and games. Acquiring these skills will motivate our students to enjoy sports for life!
