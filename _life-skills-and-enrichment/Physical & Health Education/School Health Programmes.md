The purpose of our school Health Programmes is to educate our students the importance of leading a fit and healthy lifestyle. Some of our programmes include the anti-drug ambassador activity, organized by CNB, for the Primary 4 and 5 students and the Singapore Heart Foundation’s Blood Pressure Initiative for the Primary 5 students. 

  

We also organized the Health and Wellness week for the students, which includes the Post-Exam sport activities catered for different levels and a wellness discovery assembly talk for the students, organized by HBP.

  

The Healthy Recess Programme is one of our signature programmes catered for overweight students to assist them in losing their weight through fun activities organized by the PE teachers. The teachers also coach the students on keeping fit and maintaining healthy diet at home.
