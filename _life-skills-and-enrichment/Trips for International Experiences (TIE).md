**Aesthetics and Cultural Overseas Immersion Programme to Xi An, China on 24th – 29th March 2019**

  

“Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.” ~ Ralph Waldo Emerson

  

Anchoring on the school’s internationalisation efforts to achieve the Desired Outcomes of Education, the school had organised an Aesthetics and Cultural Overseas Immersion Programme to Xi An, China from 24th to 29th March 2019. Twenty-four Gabrielite TIE ambassadors deepened their cultural appreciation and understanding of the Chinese culture through interaction opportunities with students from two Xi An schools. They gained experiential learning on how lessons are conducted in China, forged valuable friendships with their local buddies and explored places seaped in history, such as the National Heritage Park, Tang Daming Palace, Hancheng Lake, Muslim Street as well as the World’s Eighth Wonder - the Vaults of First Emperor Qin Shi Huang’s Terracotta Warriors and Horses, which was built during the Qin Dynasty. The immersion programme has created opportunities for our students like none other as they developed cultural literacy and broadened their horizons beyond the shores of Singapore.

What I learnt from the TIE trip was fascinating. I learned that the terracotta warriors had a great deal of importance to China. They were built by a great Qin Dynasty Emperor. I enjoyed running around the open spaces under the sun, as in Xi’an, the weather was cool and breezy when we were there. I found the whole trip memorable as I learnt many interesting facts about the various historical landmarks there. I had lots of fun learning about the history of China and at the same time enjoyed the Chinese cuisine!

The TIE experience to Xi’an, China was really memorable. The food, the weather and the Chinese culture are all different from Singapore. I love the weather as it is cold and I hardly found myself perspiring even after a long walk. The Chinese cuisine was delicious too! We learnt about the history of China, how people lived in the past and also about the history of the terracotta warriors. The experience was really great and Xi’an will always have a special place in my heart.

The TIE trip was very educational and fun. I learnt about the history of the terracotta warriors and the royal Qin emperor, who gave the orders to build them. We also learned about the Chinese culture and how different the Xi’an schools are from ours. If there is a chance for me to visit Xi’an, China again, I would like to visit these memorable places with my family.

The Xi’an trip was really enjoyable as I could prove to my parents that I was able to take good care of myself for the entire week. This trip allowed me to understand the history of China and helped me learn a lot about another country. I also enjoyed spending a lot of time with my friends during the trip as I learned to look out for them whenever they needed my help.
