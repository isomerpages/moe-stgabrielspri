Note: Price excludes GST. Charges for small buses (15 and below seater type) are generally higher for the host of benefits of mandatory installation of seat belts, one-to-one seating, easier access to pick up points and shorter journey time. For distance beyond 12km, it is a mutual agreement between the bus operator and subject to bus availability. Parents must agree with the price quoted by the bus operator to start the service.
