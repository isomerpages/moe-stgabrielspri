<p><strong>Department Goal</strong>
</p>
<p>The goal of the Character and Citizenship Education Department (CCE) in
St. Gabriel’s Primary School, is to inculcate values in our Gabrielites
and to develop them to be active loyal citizens who are able to contribute
to the society, are civic-conscious and resilient.</p>
<p>This is done through various vehicles like National Education (NE), CCE
lessons which are conducted during Mother Tongue lessons, our school’s
in-house Montfortian Character, Citizenship and Leadership Education (MCLE)
lessons, as well as through valuable school experiences such as Values-In-Action
(VIA) projects and CCAs.</p>

<p><strong>National Education (NE)</strong>
</p>
<p>NE strives to develop a better understanding of the country. In doing
so, we aim to develop in our students, national cohesion, emotional rootedness
and the sense of belonging to the nation.</p>
<p>Specific activities are carried out to provide opportunities for students
to interact and work together to accomplish an assigned task during the
4 core NE events – Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial
Harmony Day, National Day - that will be held in school.</p>
<p><strong>Montfortian Character, Citizenship and Leadership Education (MCLE)</strong>
</p>
<p>Every term, MCLE lessons are conducted by all teachers. During these lessons,
the story and virtues of our founder, St. Louis Marie de Montfort, is shared
with the Gabrielites. They also learn about leadership qualities using
a 3-tier student leadership framework. From his life story, Gabrielites
are encouraged to live out the school’s virtues in whatever they do.</p>
<p><strong>Values-In-Action (VIA)</strong>
</p>
<p>Recognising the need for social cohesion and civic responsibility, we
aim to develop Gabrielites to be active contributors to the society through
Values-In-Action (VIA) by levels and co-curricular activities (CCA). The
whole-school approach is in line with the school’s view on holistic education.</p>
<p>VIA activities are segmented into 3 tiers – whole school, level-specific,
and tier-specific. The students are undergo a process where they take ownership
of the VIA projects with the teachers taking on a facilitation role.</p>

<p>Some examples of VIA projects include a collaboration with Braddell Heights
grassroots on a Used Books Collection, and a Gabrielite School Experience
project that our young Primary Two students undergo to host groups of kindergarten
students. The Primary Three cohort also visit St. Luke’s Eldercare and
engage the seniors in a series of activities that they have designed and
prepared.</p>

<p><strong>Religious Education (RE)</strong>
</p>
<p>Catholic students, and non-Catholics who have chosen to opt-in,&nbsp;
attend the RE classes where our teachers work with a team of dedicated
and experienced Catechists to impart the Catholic Faith to our children.&nbsp;
All topics are aligned with those taught in MCLE classes, but discussions
would be from a Christian perspective, incorporating lessons from the life
of Christ and that of the Saints.</p>

<p><strong>Character and Citizenship Education (MTL)</strong>
</p>
<p>During Mother Tongue Lessons (MTL), students deepen their learning of
moral values through the use of cultural stories, songs, proverbs, and
practices that are unique to each MTL. The lessons also reinforce the teaching
and learning of foundational social-emotional skills.</p>
<p>The vocabulary learnt by the students during their MTL lessons at each
level provides a guide in the choice of proverbs and the activities in
the journals for CCE (MTL). Activities are contextualized and applicable
to their daily experiences.</p>
