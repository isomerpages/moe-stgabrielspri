<p><strong>Leadership Framework</strong>
</p>

Pupils a Voice”</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>The programme - “Every Gabrielite is a Leader” is based on the school’s
Montfortian beliefs to nurture all Gabrielites to become “God loving, confident
role models who lead from the heart”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Student Leadership Framework has 3 tiers: Tier 1 leadership opportunities
enable all students to take on class leadership roles such as class monitors
and subject representatives. These appointments are rotated every semester
to allow every student to have the opportunity to assume a leadership position
in class. Students who display potential to take on higher leadership roles
will be nominated for Tier 2 leadership such as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Prefects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peer Support Leaders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CCA Leaders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NE Ambassadors</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These students are likely to have shown consistent performance in their
duties, and are able to manage themselves and their peers well. The Tier
3 leaders comprise of the Head and Vice-Heads of the various groups of
Tier 2 leaders and together, they form PRIDE, which stands for Personal
Responsibility in Delivering Excellence.</p>
<p><strong>Leadership Training</strong>
</p>
<p>To equip our leaders with the necessary skills and knowledge in carrying
out their duties, leadership training is conducted twice a year, once in
every semester. These trainings are conducted by the respective Department
Heads and are targeted in providing our student leaders with the relevant
knowledge for administering their responsibilities well.</p>

all our Tier 2 leaders would recite the Leaders’ Pledge, led by the Head

community.</p>
