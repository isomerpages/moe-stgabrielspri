**Introduction**

The programme - “Every Gabrielite is a Leader” is based on the school’s Montfortian beliefs to nurture all Gabrielites to become “God loving, confident role models who lead from the heart”. 

  

The Student Leadership Framework has 3 tiers: Tier 1 leadership opportunities enable all students to take on class leadership roles such as class monitors and subject representatives. These appointments are rotated every semester to allow every student to have the opportunity to assume a leadership position in class. Students who display potential to take on higher leadership roles will be nominated for Tier 2 leadership such as:

* Prefects
* Peer Support Leaders
* CCA Leaders
* NE Ambassadors

  

These students are likely to have shown consistent performance in their duties, and are able to manage themselves and their peers well. The Tier 3 leaders comprise of the Head and Vice-Heads of the various groups of Tier 2 leaders and together, they form PRIDE, which stands for Personal Responsibility in Delivering Excellence.

  

**Leadership Training**

To equip our leaders with the necessary skills and knowledge in carrying out their duties, leadership training is conducted twice a year, once in every semester. These trainings are conducted by the respective Department Heads and are targeted in providing our student leaders with the relevant knowledge for administering their responsibilities well.

**Joint Leaders’ Investiture**

The Joint Leaders’ Investiture is an annual prestigious event which is held in the beginning of the year. During this special day, our leaders would be recognized and appointed during the ceremony. As part of the ceremony, all our Tier 2 leaders would recite the Leaders’ Pledge, led by the Head Prefect, as they promised to do their best for their class, school and community.
