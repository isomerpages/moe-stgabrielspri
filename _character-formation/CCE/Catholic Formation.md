We seek to develop our students’ knowledge and understanding of the Catholic faith, to deepen their love for Jesus and see Him in His creation. The symbols of our Catholic faith for example, the Crucifixes and statues in the school remind our students of the presence of God.</p>
<p align="justify">
We begin and end the day with prayers. Depending on liturgical calendar and season, additional prayers like Prayer to St Joseph (for Year dedicated to St Joseph) and Prayer for Examination, are also said. Both teachers and students lead the school in prayer.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">
Eucharistic Celebrations such as the Opening of the School Year Mass, Founder’s Day Mass and Thanksgiving Mass are highlights for our Catholic students. We also have a special Dedication of the School Year Mass where all 7 Montfortian-Gabrielite Education Institutions are present. During pre-Covid times, termly Masses were organised for our students. </p>
<p align="justify">
Catholic students and those interested to know more about the Catholic faith opt for Religious Education (RE) lessons. The RE programme includes Bible stories, the teachings of Jesus, teachings of the Founder, St Louis Marie de Montfort, lives of saints and key practices of the Catholic Church. The Catholic students and those interested can join the Catholic Club to be held once a week after school. </p>
<p align="justify">
During the season of Lent, priests from the Serangoon District come to school so that Gabrielites can receive the Sacrament of Reconciliation. Students are encouraged to ‘Pray, Fast and Abstain’ and do their part for the poor by saving money for the Charities Week envelopes. </p>
<p align="justify">
Chapel activities include praying the Rosary, the Divine Mercy Chaplet, watching videos on lives of saints, bible teachings and stories on salvation history. Students pray for the sick on the Feast of Our Lady of Lourdes, make cards to priests during the Feast of St John Vianey, write notes of appreciation to their grandparents on the Feast of St Anne and Joachim and pray for their Primary 6 brothers during the PSLE exams. Advent comes early to St Gabriel’s Primary, we start preparing in early November. </p>
<p align="justify">
We have a steady stream of students who come to the chapel during recess just to say a short prayer or to ask for prayers for a sick parent or sibling. Our chapel is opened all the time and students are welcome to go in and pray. </p>
<p align="justify">
As a Catholic mission church, the chapel welcomes all who wants to come in for some quiet time, to feel the presence of God who loves them dearly regardless of faith or religion. </p>
