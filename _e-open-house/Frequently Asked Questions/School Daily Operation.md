<p>Parents are not allowed to enter the classrooms or explore the school
premises during school hours on your own due to security reasons. Parents
are to report to the security guard post upon entry to pick up a ‘Visitor
Pass’ before entering the school.

<br>You will then need to proceed to the General Office where the staff will
assist you.</p>
