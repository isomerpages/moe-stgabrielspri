<p>My child is non-Catholic. Will he be taught religious education during
character classes?</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>Although our school is a mission school, only Catholics will attend Religious
Education (RE) classes. Non-Catholics can opt in upon P1 registration.
All students, Catholics and non-Catholics, go through character lessons
based on the universal values (e.g. respect and diligence) of our Founder,
St. Louis Marie de Montfort using his life stories.</p>
