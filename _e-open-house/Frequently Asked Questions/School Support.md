<p>How does the school manage bullying cases?</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>The school will not condone bullying. Bullying constitutes using deliberate
actions / words to hurt or frighten someone else, often over a period of
time, and often forcing them to do something that they do not want to do.
<br>
<br>The school will investigate the situation and take the students through
a Modified Restorative Approach (MRP) to manage the issue. Parents of the
students involved would also be notified for them to work in partnership
with the school to guide/ monitor their boys. Appropriate disciplinary
measures will also be meted out where necessary.</p>

<p><u>Tamil Language</u>
<br>The Primary 1 and 2 Tamil Syllabus focuses mainly on the introduction
of the Tamil alphabets and building of the Tamil vocabulary. The teachers
take extra care to teach the nuances of the language, especially in reading
and oral communication, to familiarize students with the language and to
build their vocabulary. At Primary 2, students go through the in-house
reading programme where they start reading graded booklets. At this stage,
parents also play an active role in supporting and monitoring their son's
progress.
<br>
<br><u>Malay Language</u>
<br>Primary 1 Malay students go through the Phonetics and Reading Programme
by MOE to establish the foundation for the learning of the Malay Language
before embarking on the Primary 1 syllabus.
<br>
<br>At St. Gabriel’s Primary School, there is also a reading and oral communication
programme for Primary 2 to 6 Malay and Tamil students. This programme renders
support to students who face challenges when communicating in their respective
languages. The respective teachers give extra support in the form of reading
and oral communication practices in class, with the use of ICT to minimize
and close the gap in oracy.
<br>
<br><u>Chinese Language</u>
<br>Teachers use an approach that scaffolds learning in the classroom, emphasizing
on the development of the four essential language skills: Listening, Speaking,
Reading and Writing. Teachers tap on the “Dudu Town Reading” programme
to cultivate the interest for reading. It is a self-paced, personalised
learning system for the Chinese language by providing students with Chinese
Story eBooks that are appropriately matched to their reading abilities.
It increases students’ motivation in reading, improve their reading skills,
build vocabulary and enhance the comprehension skills of the students.
It encourages some self-directed learning.</p>
