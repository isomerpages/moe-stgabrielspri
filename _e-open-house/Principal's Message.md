<p>Find out more through an informative talk by our Principal, Mr Martin
Tan on the history of St. Gabriel's Primary School and our founder, St.
Louis Marie De Montfort. In the video, he highlights the school's virtues
and the student outcomes of our Gabrielite 2025 - a Leader, a Sportsman,
an Achiever and many of our key initiatives for our students. Our Year
Head, Mr Andy Kong also clearly defines what it takes to be a Gabrielite
of the future. We hope you find the video useful and that St. Gabriel's
Primary School will be a choice school for your child.</p>
