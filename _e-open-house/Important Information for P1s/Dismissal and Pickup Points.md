<p>To ensure the safety and security of our students during dismissal, students
taking the school bus will be allowed to board their school buses before
we allow other motor vehicles into the school compound.</p>
<p>All P1 students will have to assemble in the school hall first and will
then be taken to the various dismissal points by the teachers.</p>
