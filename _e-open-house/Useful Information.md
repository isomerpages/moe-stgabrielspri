		<p>We are proud to have in place our very own MCLE Programme which infuses Social and Emotional learning through life stories of our Founder, St Louis Marie de Montfort. This programme encompasses both Character Education (CE) and Religious Education (RE) lessons, designed for non-Catholics and Catholics respectively.<br><br>
The lessons are carried out termly during MCLE periods. They cover topics based on the virtues of the term and aim to foster in our students awareness and the practice of the eight school virtues, namely, Self-discipline, Generosity, Perseverance, Sincerity, Loyalty, Orderliness, Respect and Diligence. 
Catholic students attend the Religious Education classes. Our teachers work with a team of dedicated and experienced Catechists to impart the Catholic Faith to our children. All topics are aligned with those taught in Character Education classes, but discussions would be from a Christian perspective, incorporating lessons from the life of Christ and that of the Saints. Mass is celebrated at least once a term.</p>
